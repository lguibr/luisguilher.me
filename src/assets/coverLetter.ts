Hi there,

I'm Luís Guilherme, a seasoned full-stack developer with over seven years of delivering robust and dynamic applications. My expertise spans TypeScript, React, Python, Go, and serverless technologies, enabling me to tackle projects ranging from breweries to traceability and crypto systems with efficiency and scalability.
In my recent role at a crypto fintech, I unified UI interfaces using React, React Native, and Electron, enhancing user experience and consistency across platforms and increasing the team productivity by consolidating single source code; I spearheaded the implementation of end-to-end testing for intricate web crypto applications utilizing Playwright in Python, alongside tackling backend challenges with Golang.
My passion for AI and decentralized technologies drives me to integrate these innovations into my work. For instance, CommitAI, a tool I developed, leverages AI language models like GPT-4 and Claude to generate meaningful commit messages from branch names, git diffs, and commit message templates, significantly improving our development workflow. Creating a Terraform CDK and TypeScript-based API bootstrap for serverless web applications exemplifies my initiative in automating cloud resource provisioning.
My technical acumen extends to game development with Pongo, a Pong and Breakout-inspired game that showcases my proficiency in Go through the Actor Model pattern. I've developed a CLI project generator in Python that streamlines project initiation with integrated CI/CD pipelines, linting and PyPI publishing.
Outside of programming, my fascination with physics and my time with my cats often inspire innovative approaches and solutions in my projects. I value collaboration, clear communication, and a problem-solving mindset, believing these are crucial for achieving outstanding results in any team endeavor.
I am eager to contribute my skills and passion to your team. I aim to push the boundaries of what's possible in web development and create impactful projects together.
Thank you for contacting me. I'm looking forward to discussing how I can contribute to the success of our future team.

Best regards,
Luís Guilherme
