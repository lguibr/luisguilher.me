# Luis Guilherme's Portfolio

This is the source code for [luisguilher.me](https://luisguilher.me), the personal website, resume, and CV of Luis Guilherme. The website is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework, with TypeScript for static type checking. The site features a unique presentation of code using the Monaco Editor, which is the same editor used in Visual Studio Code. Additionally, it employs styled-components for component-level styles and p5.js for creating graphical animations.

## Technologies Used

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Getting Started

Before you can run this project, you will need to have Node.js and Yarn installed on your local machine.


## Available Scripts

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.

#### `yarn start`

Starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `yarn build` first.

#### `yarn lint`

This command will run both ESLint for code quality checking and Prettier for formatting all the source files inside the `src` directory.
