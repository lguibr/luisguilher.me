## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Senior Engineer specializing in **AI pipelines**, **high-performance systems**, and **cross-platform architecture**.  
My style blends **physics-driven reasoning** with practical product execution:  
**deterministic, optimized, and observable.**

Experience across **Fintech (Crypto)**, **Logistics**, and **Supply Chain**, owning systems end-to-end from architecture → performance → delivery.

---

## SELECTED ACHIEVEMENTS
- **50% latency reduction** in LLM pipelines via parallel execution trees, dynamic branching, and observability-driven refactors.  
- **Unified React, React Native, and Electron** into a single codebase powering a major institutional crypto trading interface.  
- **Designed a distributed self-play engine** (AlphaZero style) using Ray + PyTorch for large-scale RL training.  
- **Engineered a high-concurrency multiplayer backend** in Go using a custom Actor Model implementation (zero external deps).  

---

## TECHNICAL SKILLS
**Languages:** TypeScript (Node/React), Python, Go  
**AI/ML:** LLMs (GPT/Claude), PyTorch, TensorFlow.js, Reinforcement Learning (MCTS / AlphaZero)  
**Infrastructure:** AWS, GCP, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes  
**Testing:** Playwright, Jest, PyTest
